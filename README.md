**USGS Earthquake Map**

The HTML file inside the Leaflet Part-1 folder shows a world map visualization of earthquake data from the past seven days.  The circles correspond to the location of each specific earthquake, while the size of the circle corresponds to the magnitude of each quake (the larger the circle, the greater the magnitude).  Colors of each circle are related to the depth of each earthquake.  When the user clicks on each circle, a pop-up shows the magnitude, depth and distance from the nearest city for each data point.
